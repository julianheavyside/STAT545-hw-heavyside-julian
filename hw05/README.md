## Reflections on the assignment

I really had to review the forcats tools as I don't think we covered them very well in class.

It was interesting to see the effects of ordering factors using the different methods. This seems super useful for me in the future with plotting, so I will keep this in mind. I spent a lot of time fighting with `arrange()` before plotting.

I think I was missing something from the file saving/loading section of the assignment. I'm aware of the basic differences between `read.csv()` and `read_csv()`, but I don't think my sample data was in a format that could reveal these differences during a comparison of the two methods. This is something I will return to.
