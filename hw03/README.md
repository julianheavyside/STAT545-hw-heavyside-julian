## Reflections on the assignment

I learned some new things about ggplot, such as how to adjust the labeling of axes with theme(). This is similar to what you can do in base R plotting, but it's much easier and faster to make a nice looking graph. I love how easy it is to do what I believe is a time series plot. I admit, I got a bit lazy with labeling the plot axes, and I could probably put more effort into making it all look nicer. 

This assignment required much more googling and tinkering thant the previous hw, but I feel like I learned a lot more about how to do *real* data exploration and analysis. This will (and already has) come in handy with analyzing my own data.

I still have to refer back to my lecture notes, or plots I made in earlier tasks, but it's all starting to feel natural and fluid. The more I uncover with `ggplot` and `dplyr`, the more I realize there is soooo much you can do with these tools. I'm trying not to get overwhelmed...
